This is documentation for our Database and Tables

VPC: default vpc
RDS Database: cpsc4910-team22-db2

Credentials for RDS
Database Name: cpsc4910-team22-db2
Master User: admin
Master pass: ThereWasATeamHere!

FYI this should only be used if a table manually needs to be accessed. Llamda and otherwise should be configured through AWS.
I reccomend using mySQL workbench to access it, as it simplifies and speeds up connecting to the DB.
