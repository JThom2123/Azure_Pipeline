Folder Version 0.1 has a separate homepage.html for 
each of the user types (admin, sponsor, driver). 

NOTE: Version 0.1 has proper text-placement adjusting whenever 
the window size changes.

============================================================

Folder Version 0.2 has one homepage.html that contains all of the 
different user layouts. You can toggle through the different 
layouts via the "space" key; this mimics the effect of changing 
the page layout as different users login. 

NOTE: Version 0.2 does not have the text display properly for 
smaller window sizes (if this is something that needs touched on, I 
can double back later).
